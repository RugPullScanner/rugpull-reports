## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence involves transferring ownership to address(0), effectively renouncing ownership and disabling owner-only functions. A large burn operation by a non-owner drastically reduces the total supply, potentially manipulating market perception of scarcity. Additionally, a non-owner executes a TransferFrom operation, moving significant token amounts, which could be used to drain liquidity.
