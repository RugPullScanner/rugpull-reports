## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence demonstrates potential vulnerabilities in the contract that could be exploited for a rug pull. The lock function allows setting an unlockTime in milliseconds, which is inconsistent with expected behavior, potentially allowing funds to be locked indefinitely or mishandled. The collect function was accessed by an unauthorized external caller, indicating a lack of proper access control. The transferLockOwnership function was executed without verifying the caller's authorization, allowing ownership transfer to an external address without checks.
