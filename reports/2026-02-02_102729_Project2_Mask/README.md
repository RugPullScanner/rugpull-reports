    ## 🔍 Triggered Conditions

    1. Hidden Mint Function: The 'mint' function allows arbitrary minting of tokens by accounts with God Mode.
2. Limiting Sell Order: The 'getSellLimit' function restricts selling based on holding duration, potentially allowing privileged accounts to bypass this restriction.
3. Leaking Token: The 'transfer' function includes exemptions for God Mode accounts, allowing them to bypass normal transfer restrictions.

## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence allowed an account to be set to God Mode, enabling it to mint a large number of tokens and transfer them without restrictions, facilitating a potential rug pull by dumping these tokens.
