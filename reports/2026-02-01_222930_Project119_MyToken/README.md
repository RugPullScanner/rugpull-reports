    ## 🔍 Triggered Conditions

    1. Hidden Mint Function: The 'mint' function was called by an account that was granted the MINTER_ROLE, allowing arbitrary minting of tokens.
2. Leaking Token: The 'transfer' function was used to move a large amount of tokens to another account, followed by a 'burn' operation, effectively draining the tokens.

## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence allowed an account to be granted the MINTER_ROLE, enabling it to mint a large amount of tokens. These tokens were then transferred to another account and subsequently burned, simulating a rug pull by draining the token supply.
