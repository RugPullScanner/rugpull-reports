## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence involved the 'removeLimits' function, which allows the contract owner to mint an excessive amount of tokens to their own balance, followed by a large transfer to an external address. This behavior is consistent with a rug pull where the owner can inflate their balance and drain liquidity.
