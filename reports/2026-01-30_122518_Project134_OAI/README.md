    ## 🔍 Triggered Conditions

    1. Hidden Mint Function: The function `removeLimits` allows the `_taxWallet` to increase its balance by `devAmount`, which is a large value, without any clear justification or limitation.
2. Leaking Token: The `delegate` function allows the `_taxWallet` to manipulate the balance of any `delegatee` by multiplying it with `buyCount`, which is currently zero, effectively setting the balance to zero.

## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The sequence allows the `_taxWallet` to significantly increase its balance through `removeLimits` and potentially manipulate other balances using `delegate`, enabling a rug pull by transferring or dumping these tokens.
