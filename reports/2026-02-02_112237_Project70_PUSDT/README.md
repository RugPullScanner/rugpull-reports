## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence allows the owner to set extremely high mint and burn fees (95%) and redirect these fees to an external address. The owner can then mint and burn tokens, effectively transferring a large portion of the token supply to the fee recipient, which can be controlled by the owner or a malicious actor. This setup enables a rug pull by draining value from the token holders.
