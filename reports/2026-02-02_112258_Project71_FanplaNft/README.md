    ## 🔍 Triggered Conditions

    1. Hidden Mint Function: The adminMint function allows arbitrary minting of tokens to any address without restriction.
2. Limiting Sell Order: The setSBTMode function can restrict token transfers, potentially allowing only the contract owner to sell tokens.
3. Leaking Token: The setTokenPrice function set the token price to zero, enabling potential unauthorized transfers or sales.

## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence allows the contract owner to mint a large number of tokens to a specific address, set the token price to zero, and enable SBT mode to restrict transfers. This combination can be used to execute a rug pull by minting excessive tokens, setting their value to zero, and restricting other users from selling, while the owner can still sell or transfer tokens.
