    ## 🔍 Triggered Conditions
    
    1. The adminRescueTokens function was called by the owner, allowing the transfer of tokens to an arbitrary address.
2. The setFeeCollector function was used to set the fee collector and auto collect account to an external address, potentially allowing unauthorized fund collection.
