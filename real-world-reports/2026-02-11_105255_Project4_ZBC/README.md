    ## 🔍 Triggered Conditions
    
    1. Hidden Mint Function: The mintOfOwner function allows arbitrary minting of tokens to any address by the admin, which can be used to create a large number of tokens and execute a rug pull.
2. Limiting Sell Order: The isTaxExcluded mapping can be manipulated by the admin to exclude specific addresses from tax, potentially allowing the admin to sell tokens without incurring the usual tax, facilitating a rug pull.

## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence allowed the admin to mint a large number of tokens to an external address and then transfer those tokens to another address without incurring any tax, which could be used to drain liquidity from the pool.
