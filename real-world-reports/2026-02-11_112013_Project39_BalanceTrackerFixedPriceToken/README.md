## ⚔️ Attack Path Summary

The function call sequence involved the owner depositing a significant amount of tokens and then immediately calling the 'drain' function to transfer all collected fees to a drainer address. This sequence allows the owner to extract funds from the contract, which is consistent with rug pull behavior.
